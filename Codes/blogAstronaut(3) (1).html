<blockquote><p>I'm not sure how long it's been. My only

reference points now are distant stars

and planets that basically all look the

same

and don't appear to be moving much from

here. The radio and GPS cut out some time

ago

and the manual propulsion system engines

were damaged in the initial collision.</p>

I've since been drifting alone and

disconnected in some unknown direction

towards something or nothing i suppose

both are sort of the same to me at this

point

i can only assume i'm moving rather fast

considering the speed at which we were

hit

but it honestly feels more like i'm just

floating in place like i'm submerged in

a literal infinity pool

with no edge or surface my only hope

left is that this is some strange dream

or hallucination

and i'm still on the ground somewhere

soon to come back to reality at any

moment

admittedly early on when the reality of

this whole situation really first

started to set in

i seriously considered that as a

possibility i guess hoped might be more

accurate

my brain's imaginative wishful nature

trying to conjure up and sustain its

last bit of artificial hopefulness

almost convincing me that what is real

isn't and vice versa

i've since given up such hope at least

of that form

i realized around the same time that i

had a decision to make

to either continue on in terror and

paranoia

fueled by the hope that there was

something to be done something i could

do

some other way this whole thing could go

or

i could sit back and enjoy the stars the

decision was pretty obvious

i'm going to die and no one can save me

and i only have so much time left

and i'm going to enjoy it i float

through the void now

free perhaps more than i have ever felt

or imagined before

totally and completely free i feel

infinity play with my limbs

as its laws of motion carry me like a

child's plush toy

i just let it i do not flail i do not

fight it

i just float i think about where it

might be taking me

where i will end up what distant space i

will float onto

what my final view of everything will be

you know i have seen the same night sky

nearly every night of my life

and i've had the great fortune of being

in a profession that has given me the

opportunity to see it from all sorts of

different angles

close and afar but right now swallowed

up by it totally

with no sight of home further out than

perhaps anyone has ever been

it looks completely different or perhaps

it feels completely different

either way in this i realize now more

than ever

just how used to the insanity of

everything we so easily become

to the grave imminent dangers of living

and moving through an unending and

unknown space

the unfathomable depth of potential and

mystery

that is just a short float above our

heads at all times

i can't help but laugh to myself at how

bored we so easily become

how much we struggle to be dazzled by

awe and silenced by humility

we must be the only thing cursed with

the tendency to reduce the magnificent

to tedium to analyze beauty into

ugliness

to reduce our incredible position to

misery

we are so small it took no more than one

cycle of oxygen for essentially all

clear traces of home to disappear from

my vision forever

all the greatest heroes and sages and

leaders and so on

from here i don't see any of them

we forget that we are a life still in

its adolescent years at best

yet to even really leave home our

species still filled with the angst and

juvenile rebellion of a teenager

the universe must laugh at our arrogant

ignorance our smug righteousness

our poutiness we still think we know

everything but we know damn near nothing

about anything

like our pioneering ancestors of every

form discovered lands and worlds and

ways of being that we take for granted

now

as the status quo great unknown lands of

the future await us

great unknown manners and knowledge of

how to live and be

unknown turmoil ii casualties of this

kind and far

far worse of course to grow up

to age to toy with the universe and

venture out into the unknown

always carries its great uncertainty and

risk but it is perhaps one of the most

beautiful imperatives of our kind to do

so

to live is to be afraid but perhaps to

center that fear on something that

unites and grows

and reveals wonder is to be afraid with

some purpose

i don't know what else could life

possibly be but a series of new horizons

new views a constant rediscovery of

beauty and wonder

i'm going to die a casualty of this

cause and i wouldn't want it any other

way

[Music]

if i have any remaining wish it's that

this was not all in vain

this fatal mission and every pair of

shoulders that it stood on

every prior fatal mission every prior

successful mission

i hope that more and more of my kind

will see and feel what i do right now

with less finality and more intention to

continue on into the darkness

bringing the lights of their own

creation illuminating the heavens and

revealing them as new homes

today the great frontiers are above us

into the once believed heavens that we

need not be dead to touch

we can touch them now we will we will

if we can survive our teenage

carelessness and anguish and avoid the

irreversible self-harm

that so many adolescences fall victim to

if we continue to grow and learn and

survive together

we will live together up here somewhere

into forever

we either live together or die together

i don't know how long my suit will

survive after me i don't know if these

words will ever be heard by anyone else

no matter the case i'll be okay i'll be

dead

but if anyone does find me or rather

what was once me

if anyone finds this recording please

know that i was happy while speaking

these words

i have lived a good life an aesthetic

voyager who lived and died by the space

that enthralled him

if you have not already i hope even if

just for a moment

you see and feel what i do right now i

hope you see past me

i hope you find reason to continue as a

string of life

extending further and further out

reaching with excitement and wonder into

the infinite yet continually

insufficient frontier

don't cut the string short for trivial

absurd reasons

if it's absurd to continue then it's

absurd to cut it all

short and if you can't find the reasons

to continue

my friendly suggestion is make them up

a group of scientists spacesuit

engineers language experts

historians and technologists all working

with the international orbital debris

monitoring and recovery program

look down at a strange audio playback

speaker device

as it concludes the last recording

contained on it it is attached to what

can only be surmised as a half-burnt

spacesuit helmet

some strip parts of the neck and upper

torso portion of the suit

still attached it appears somehow

futuristic and otherworldly

yet entirely human and familiar almost

blending science fiction with basic

simple human engineering all the

materials are known and traceable to

earth

and the suggested body shape is mostly

anatomically consistent with a human

the logos and symbols on the spacesuit

however after having been extensively

analyzed appear to not match anything

known by any space program

private or federal additionally the

surviving technology components appear

fairly advanced

alluding to some sort of high-capacity

oxygen sustainment system

and advanced temperature regulation and

damage resistance

some of the mechanics even still

functioning none of which quite match

any known current technologies

but all of which seem to be

understandable through some reverse

engineering

the audio recording after sufficient

cross-analysis and expert translation

appears to have been spoken in a strange

blend of different but still mostly

known

ancient languages and it is essentially

fully able

to be translated the group of scientists

and experts

completely perplexed consider and

discuss what can only be described

as a letter in a bottle that happened to

float ashore

after years and years of aimless

floating from some distant time

past our future distant land near or far

or some mix of both an artifact of

possibility
